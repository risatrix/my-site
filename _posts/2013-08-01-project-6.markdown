description: In 2013, the Texas Tribune added several more tracks to its program. This created the perfect opportunity for a content audit. In order to accomodate the number tracks, I chose to employ an off-canvas menu based on this idea, which allowed the designer to pursue a bolder, less cluttered approach -- you can compare the <a href="http://festival.texastribune.org/festival/2012/home/">before</a> and <a href="http://festival.texastribune.org/festival/2013/home/">after</a>. Successive festivals have continued to use the new structure.
