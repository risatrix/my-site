The Texas Tribune's signature event is the Texas Tribune Festival. Held in the fall of every year, it brings together citizens, politicans, and policy experts in what has been called "Woodstock for Wonks". It started  with four event tracks in 2010, and by 2013 it had grown to nine event tracks and numerous related special events. In addition, the site was not originally to be responsive. In my view, this meant it was a perfect opportunity for a content audit. In order to accomodate the growing number of tracks, I chose to employ an off-canvas menu I'd been [reading about](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/); I was particularly excited to by the minimal use of JavaScript and the fast performance of CSS transitions. Our audit and menu allowed the designer to pursue a bolder, module-driven approach. You can compare the [before](http://festival.texastribune.org/festival/2012/home/) and [after](http://festival.texastribune.org/festival/2013/home/). Successive festivals have continued to use the new structure.
