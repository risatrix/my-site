"Project Hummingbird" is our internal code name for the Texas Tribune site redesign. In keeping with best practices, we planned a gradual approach, starting with of the story page. As project lead, I've conducted stakeholder interviews, user interviews, and content exercises. In addition, I asked our lead developer to pull metrics on current page use, and to work closely with the design team to produce rapid, mobile-first protoypes that will create the basis for our site's modular design system. So far, we're iterating on code prototypes, and we're hoping to get our beta in front of readers by spring 2016. In running this project, I am particularly inspired by Kevin Hoffman's "Co-Design, Not Redesign" [philosophy](https://vimeo.com/131476603) as well as his approach to  [designing meetings](https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2012/12/14/kevin-hoffman-designing-stellar-meetings/).
