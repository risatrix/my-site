description: A stylist I knew was thinking of a branded address app for her salon. I made some wireframes, chose a color theme, and built the protoype using Ruby on Rails, jQuery mobile, and SASS. It was a really fun way to expand my skills! Demo <a href="http://bettyapp.herokuapp.com/">here, repo <a href="https://github.com/risatrix/bettyApp">here</a>.
