description: A stylist I knew was thinking of a branded address app for her salon. I made some wireframes, chose a color theme, and built the protoype using Ruby on Rails, jQuery mobile, and SASS. It was a really fun way to expand my skills! Demo [here](http://bettyapp.herokuapp.com/), repo [here](https://github.com/risatrix/bettyApp).
