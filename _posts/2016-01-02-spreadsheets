 I often joke that I'm a content strategist masquerading as a tech director. Having an initmate knowledge of database models gives you a real
 appreciation for information architecture; it started when I would make csvs from the various parts of our site (this is where having some backend programming really helps content audits). But that could only do so much; what you have, in the end, is still a list of urls, titles, and owners -- the real work begins when you decide whether to keep, archive, or trash, and with hashing out the details of ownership and governance.

 TL;DR This is a collection of my favorite spreadsheets.

 Ads are an interesting issue, especially since in news, there's a strict dividing line between business and editorial. But because of that, the ad units were a mess -- the system spit out a csv of 222 units, only 90 or so were active. I then sifted through our code to see which "active" units actually appeared, and found that over 40 did not. I made the final spreadsheet so that we could all look at the ads by content type, in order to facilitate discussions between sponsorship and editorial.

 The next item on my list was our generic pages (or "flat pages" in Django parlance). These were tough; there was not author or date attached, and over 300 of them had breakable javascript.
