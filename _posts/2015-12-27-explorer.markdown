Too often, data-driven apps are informative, but not engaging. Because this app informs people about their lawmakers, I wanted to make it inviting, and maybe even a little fun. I'd been reading about interesting [hover effects](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/08/circle-hover-effects-with-css-transitions/), and hoped that by using them, combined with the arrow and pictures, I'd make the pages a little more engaging. I ended up using the Masonry library for the filtering effect, which was a little heavy-duty in retrospect; but given the time constraints, I'm pretty pleased with the project.
