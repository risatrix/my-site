description: For this project, I was extremely nspired by Kevin Hoffman's "Co-Design, Not Redesign" [talk](https://vimeo.com/131476603) as well as his approach to [designing meetings](https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2012/12/14/kevin-hoffman-designing-stellar-meetings/). I conduected stakeholder interviews, designed a content exercise, conducted user interviews. In addition, I asked our lead developer to pull metrics on current page use, and to work closerly with the design team to produce rapid, mobile-first protoypes that will let us start to use a modular desing system. So far, we've avoided meetings for meetings' sake and are hoping to get our beta in front of users by March 2016.
