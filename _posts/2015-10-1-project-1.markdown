description: Project Hummingbird is the code name we gave to our plans for a site redesign. In running this project, I was extremely inspired by Kevin Hoffman's "Co-Design, Not Redesign" <a href="https://vimeo.com/131476603">talk</a> as well as his approach to <a href="https://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2012/12/14/kevin-hoffman-designing-stellar-meetings/">designing meetings</a>. I conducted stakeholder interviews, user interviews, and content exercises. In addition, I asked our lead developer to pull metrics on current page use, and to work closely with the design team to produce rapid, mobile-first protoypes that will be the start of our modular design system. So far, we've avoided meetings for meetings' sake and are hoping to get our beta in front of users by spring 2016.
