description: Too often, data-driven apps aren't terribly inviting. Because this app aimed to inform people about their lawmakers, I wanted to make it inviting and fun. I'd been reading about circle <a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2012/08/08/circle-hover-effects-with-css-transitions/">hover effects</a>, and hoped that, combined with the arrow and pictures, would make the page a little more engaging. I ended up using Masonry.js for the filtering, which was a little heavy-duty in retrospect; but given the time limits, I'm pretty pleased with the project.
