Teaching was one of my earliest UX "a-ha" moments: The students simply wouldn't read endnotes because flipping to the back of the books was too much work. Same-page footnotes are a far better solution when reading on paper, but unfortunately I haven't seen them used in digitual reading. That makes me sad -- I mean, notes are great! They can contain anything from helpful information to entire chapters (cf. David Foster Wallace). So, when I found out a a play I'd co-translated was being [put on](http://dailybruin.com/2013/12/05/women-in-congress-updates-aristophanes-for-modern-era) at UCLA, I wanted to put it online with notes that felt as effortless as possible for the reader. The demo is [here](http://risatrix.github.io/internote), and the repo is [here](https://github.com/risatrix/internote).
