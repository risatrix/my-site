description: Teaching was one of my earliest UX experiences. The students simply wouldn't read endnotes because flipping to the back of the books was too much work. Footnotes were a far better solution for reading on paper, but unfortunately I haven't seen many of them in online readers. That makes me sad. I mean, notes are great! They can be anything from cool information to art (cf. David Foster Wallace). So, when I found out a a play I'd co-translated was being <href="http://dailybruin.com/2013/12/05/women-in-congress-updates-aristophanes-for-modern-era/">put on</a> at UCLA, I wanted to put the online, with notes that felt as effortless as possible for the reader. The demo is <a href="http://risatrix.github.io/internote/">here</a>, and the repo is <a href="https://github.com/risatrix/internote">here</a>.
