                    <p class="text-muted">A lot of things. Sometime professor, current developer, eternal <strikethrough>pessimist</strikethrough> strategist.In my current position, I do a lot of cross-departmental things, such as working with sponsorship to make sure our ads generate the right amount of revenue, or encouraging folks to incorporate user research and data into their design.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">Often, the hardest part of starting or updating web projects is understanding your options without feeling overwhelmed. I love helping people plan their content strategy, understand user experience, and keep up with best practices in digital publishing. I'm available for consulting anywhere, but if you want me to move to somewhere like NYC or DC or the like, you are probably out of luck.

                    <p class="text-muted">Before you worry about technology stacks, you need to be clear about your project goals and your definition of success. I'll help you focus on the problems you're trying to solve, rather than choosing the first technical solutions that jump to mind. In addition, I balance the needs of user and business with the available technology. I love helping organziations and individuals find the right strategy to address all of the above.</p>
