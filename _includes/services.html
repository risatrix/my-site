I'm good at those, and also good at inspiring folks to do their best work towards a common goal. It doesn't hurt that I used to be a Latin professor; I love the challenge of bringing different stakeholders into the discussion.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">To achieve your digital goals, you need to allow your design to be data-driven, and your development to be user-centered. Sometimes it's hard to hear honest feedback from the people you think you're serving -- but it's essential! While you're at it, you'll want to make sure readers are clicking that beautifully designed button, and can read that awesome font.</p>
